## Initial benchmark results

![results](./assets/results.png)

As we can see from the results. The Rust version is around 37.5 times faster than the Go version
Benchmark 1 is the Rust version, Benchmark 2 is the Go version.

### Caveat

Eventually, I will also create a Zig rewrite of this to compare all 3 binaries, not because its supposed to create a dick measuring contest for the communities of each respective language but simply because I want to see if what I wrote is at all comparable to each other given I am new to Rust in ints entirety and Zig I am at best an advanced beginner.
